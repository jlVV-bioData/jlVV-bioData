## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
My name is **Jos√© Luis** and I'm **biologist** and **data analyst**.

I discovered my passion for **biology** by studying its wonderful complexity. I graduated in **Biology** from the University of Murcia, where I was an intern in the Ecology department, collaborating on a project to control invasive exotic plant species. Additionally, I spent a **year studying abroad**, which allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and enrich my education.

Currently, as **scientific** I am expanding my skills in **technology** and **data science**, aiming to lead innovative projects that merge biology and technology to advance our society. I‚Äôm focused on leveraging data to solve complex biological problems and drive impactful research.
